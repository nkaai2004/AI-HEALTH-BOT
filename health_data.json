    "Hey",
    "Hi, I'm EVE, your AI health expert. You're in a safe space to ask anything or express any concerns you might have.",
    "What is a healthy diet?",
    "A balanced diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.",
    "How much exercise should I get?",
    "Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.",
    "Why is sleep important?",
    "Regular sleep improves concentration, supports the immune system, and enhances overall mood and well-being.",
    "Using dumbbells can definitely put a strain on your lower back, especially if the form isn't perfect or if the weights are too heavy. Have you noticed if the pain gets worse after specific exercises or movements? For example, does it hurt more after squats, deadlifts, or any particular dumbbell exercises?",
    "Yes. My head is aching too.",
    "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing both lower back pain and a headache. Let's try to address both issues. First, regarding your lower back pain, do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet? This can help us determine if there's any nerve involvement. For your headache, can you describe the type of pain you're experiencing? Is it a throbbing pain, a sharp pain, or a dull ache? And where exactly is the pain located (e.g., forehead, temples, back of the head)?",
    "I've been feeling a little tired lately.",
    "Feeling tired can be due to a variety of reasons. Let's start by understanding more about your daily routine and any other symptoms you might be experiencing.",
    "Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently? For example, are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up feeling unrefreshed?",
    "I wake up feeling unrefreshed.",
    "Waking up feeling unrefreshed can be quite frustrating and might contribute to both your tiredness and headaches.",
    "Do you snore or have you been told that you snore during sleep? This can sometimes indicate sleep apnea, which can affect sleep quality.",
    "I don't snore.",
    "Thanks for letting me know. Since snoring isn't an issue, let's consider other factors that might be affecting your sleep quality and contributing to your tiredness and headaches.",
    "Do you consume caffeine or any other stimulants, especially in the afternoon or evening? This can sometimes interfere with sleep quality.",
    "I don't consume caffeine. I take tea tho.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. Tea does contain caffeine, although usually in smaller amounts compared to coffee. It might still affect your sleep if consumed later in the day.",
    "Let's consider another aspect: Do you experience any stress or anxiety that might be affecting your sleep and overall well-being? Stress can often manifest as physical symptoms like headaches and back pain.",
    "Yeah, I have anxiety.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. Anxiety can indeed contribute to both sleep disturbances and physical symptoms like headaches and back pain.",
    "Have you noticed if your anxiety symptoms have been more pronounced recently? For example, are you experiencing more frequent or intense episodes of anxiety?",
    "More frequent but not intense.",
    "Thank you for clarifying. It's important to address both the physical and emotional aspects of your health.",
    "Have you tried any techniques or treatments to manage your anxiety, such as mindfulness, yoga, or speaking with a mental health professional?",
    "Nope. None of the above.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. Since you haven't tried any specific techniques or treatments for your anxiety, it might be helpful to explore some options that could improve both your mental and physical well-being.",
    "Let's focus on your lower back pain for a moment. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relief methods, such as applying a hot or cold pack, or taking pain relievers like ibuprofen or paracetamol?",
    "Leave the back pain alone. I have issues with cramps.",
    "Understood. Let's focus on your cramps.",
    "Can you tell me more about the cramps you're experiencing? Are they muscle cramps, menstrual cramps, or another type of cramp?",
    "Menstrual cramps.",
    "Thank you for clarifying. Menstrual cramps can be quite uncomfortable and disruptive.",
    "Can you describe the intensity of your menstrual cramps? Are they mild, moderate, or severe?",
    "They go from moderate to severe.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. Moderate to severe menstrual cramps can be quite challenging to manage.",
    "Do you experience any other symptoms along with the cramps, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headaches?",
    "All of the above.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. Experiencing multiple symptoms along with menstrual cramps can be quite distressing.",
    "Have you noticed if your cramps and associated symptoms are consistent every month, or do they vary in intensity and occurrence?",
    "They vary in occurrence. Might happen today but not next month.",
    "Thank you for that information. Variability in symptoms can sometimes indicate underlying factors that fluctuate.",
    "Have you ever consulted a gynecologist about these symptoms, or had any tests done to rule out conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?",
    "No, I haven't been able to do that.",
    "I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Let's try to get to the bottom of it together.",
    "Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to make your menstrual cramps and associated symptoms worse? For example, do certain foods, activities, or stress levels seem to correlate with more severe symptoms?",
    "Yeah, certain foods like gluten and lactose can cause severe symptoms. Stress levels are low.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like certain foods might be triggering or exacerbating your symptoms.",
    "Have you tried eliminating gluten and lactose from your diet to see if it helps reduce the severity of your menstrual cramps and associated symptoms?",
    "Yes. It has worked.",
    "That's great to hear that eliminating gluten and lactose has helped reduce your symptoms.",
    "Given that dietary changes have made a difference, it might be helpful to keep a food diary to track what you eat and how it affects your symptoms. This can provide more insights into other potential triggers.",
    "Have you tried any specific remedies or treatments for your menstrual cramps, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, herbal teas, or heat therapy?",
    "Yeah, I buy Zulu MR or Acetal MR. Heat therapy doesn't help.",
    "Thank you for sharing that. It's good to know that you've tried some remedies.",
    "Since you mentioned using Zulu MR or Acetal MR, which are muscle relaxants, have you found them effective in managing your menstrual cramps?",
    "Very effective.",
    "I'm glad to hear that Zulu MR or Acetal MR have been effective for you.",
    "Given that these medications are helping, it might be useful to consider any potential side effects or interactions with other medications you might be taking. Are you currently on any other medications or supplements?",
    "I'm not on medication.",
    "Thank you for letting me know. Since you're not on any other medications, it simplifies things a bit.",
    "Have you noticed any side effects from using Zulu MR or Acetal MR, such as drowsiness, dizziness, or gastrointestinal issues?",
    "No.",
    "That's good to hear that you haven't experienced any side effects from the medications.",
    "Since your cramps vary in occurrence and you've identified dietary triggers, it might be helpful to continue monitoring your diet and symptoms. Additionally, considering your anxiety, managing stress through techniques like mindfulness or yoga could potentially help with overall well-being.",
    "Would you be interested in exploring some stress management techniques or dietary adjustments further?",
    "Thank you.",
    "You're welcome! I'm here to help. Let's continue to ensure we cover everything thoroughly.",
    "Have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle itself, such as irregular periods, heavier or lighter bleeding, or spotting between periods?",
    "Your feedback is really important to me. Are there any things you think I could have done better? Also, anything you liked about our interaction?",
    "Hey, you can only send me 30 messages in a day for now. You'll be able to send more messages tomorrow. If you had a good time with me, give me ."
